This is the Recipe project for HTML/CSS
This is going to be where I am going to practice all I have learned in the HTML section. I will also probably integrate some CSS once I learn that, but I will catalogue all of that later on (currently 10/31 @ 13:36)
Adding CSS elements for funsies (11/3 @ 11:15)
