        <h2>Mushroom and Broccoli Chow Mein noodles. This dish is super customizeable and easy. The following recipe is a guideline, and can be substituted however you want <em>(I add a lot more sesame oil than the recipe calls for)</em></h2>
        <h3>Ingredients (Food)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Noodles of your choice <em>(I use Japanese udon)</em></li>
            <li>1 head broccoli, <strong>cut into florettes</strong></li>
            <li>8 oz. mushrooms <em>(crimini and bella are best)</em></li>
            <li>1 bunch Scallions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ingredients (Sauce)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crushed Red Peppers (to taste)</li>
            <li>3 parts Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>2 parts Oyster Sauce</li>
            <li>1 part Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>1 part Rice Wine Vinegar</li>
            <li>1 part Cane Sugar</li>
            <li>1 part Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Bring half a medium pot of water to a boil</li>
            <li>In the large skillet, add both the mushrooms and the broccoli in dry <em>(we want them to not get mushy, so putting them in dry will allow liquid to be brought out and leave)</em>. Let them sautee until the edges of the broccoli begin to char and the mushrooms are soft but not shrivelled. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the pot boils, add the noodles and let boil for 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. If using fresh noodles, be careful not to make them mushy.</li>
            <li>Once noodles are done, drain them and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking and prevent them from sticking.</li>
            <li>As noodles and veggies cool a bit to prevent overcooking in the next step, make your sauce! Combine all the sauce ingredients together and adjust to taste. The sauce will end up slightly richer than what is in the bowl, so don't overdo any ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once your sauce is done, add 1 tbsp of canola to the pan from earlier and throw in veggies and noodles and sautee briefly to mix.</li>
            <li>Once uniform, add as much sauce as you want and sautee until at serving temperature!</li>
        </ol>
