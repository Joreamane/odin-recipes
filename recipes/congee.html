        <h2>Congee is a super easy and filling dish made by just cooking rice longer and with more water. Instead of the normal 1:2 rice to water ratio, it is more of a 1:5. This makes it more of a rice porridge and practically anything you would eat in a regular rice bowl can be had in congee!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Rice</li>
            <li>8-12 cups water <em>(just be prepared to add more)</em></li>
            <li>Mushrooms <em>(whatever your favorites are)</em></li>
            <li>Eggs <em>(I usually scramble mine, but if you would like hardboiled or even <a href="https://www.peteandgerrys.com/egg-recipes/soy-sauce-eggs-shoyu-tamago">these soy eggs</a> then plan for that!)</em></li>
            <li>Soy sauce (to taste)</li>
            <li>Sesame oil (to taste)</li>
            <li>Sriracha (optional)</li>
            <li>Chicken stock powder (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, rinse off the rice and add to pot with 5 gallons of water as well as enough chicken stock powder to your liking. Keep the rest of the water on hand, as we will add it in stages.</li>
            <li>bring to boil and then immediately lower heat to bring to a simmer</li>
            <li>Keep the simmer, adding water as it evaporates. You want to aim for a porridge consistency, looking for the rice grains to break down</li>
            <li>As that cooks, whisk up some eggs and slice the mushrooms and let sit.</li>
            <li>Right before you are ready to take the rice off the heat (about 3-5 minutes before), drop some sliced mushrooms on top of the congee and let them steam there. Scramble your eggs now as well in a small skillet to the side</li>
            <li>Once your eggs and congee are done, use a ladel to add the congee to a bowl, trying to keep the mushrooms on top. Place some egg on top and dress with soy sauce, sesame oil and sriracha to taste!</li>
        </ol>
